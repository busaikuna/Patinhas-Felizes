# Patinhas-Felizes

(Under development) An innovative social network developed within the scope of the Senac Integrative Project, specifically designed to assist NGOs and individuals in the adoption of animals. This platform facilitates the posting and sharing of adoption-related posts, providing a safe and accessible space to connect animals in need of a home with people willing to adopt them. In addition to enabling the creation of detailed profiles for each animal, the social network offers communication tools so that interested parties can interact directly with those responsible for the adoptions, promoting a more efficient and humane process. Our mission is not only to facilitate the adoption of animals but also to create a community engaged in promoting animal welfare.
